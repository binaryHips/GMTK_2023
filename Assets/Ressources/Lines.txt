//Colonel lines

COLONEL_greetings ; Greetings soldier. I'm the Colonel, but you can call me just Colonel. I'll be the one guiding you through your mission. ; /Colonel/colonel_greetings

COLONEL_mission ; You're currently in Reversistan. It's a country far from civilisation. We don't know much about except that they're in war and possess a large amount of lithium mines. Of course we're here to pacify those mines and exploit this war. ; /Colonel/colonel_mission

COLONEL_mission_2 ; This is one of their military sites. Your objective is to kill their boss. I trust you with that matter. ; /Colonel/colonel_mission_2

COLONEL_asks_pickup_cigarettes ; How look! they have cigarettes, so far away from civilisation? break one out kid, you deserve it. ; /Colonel/colonel_asks_pickup_cigarettes

COLONEL_pickup_first_cigarettes ; Oh my god it actually healed you. Guess once we're done pacifying I'll start an import company. ; /Colonel/colonel_pickup_first_cigarettes



COLONEL_gg_you_win ; Nice job kid! You killed their- wait... I just got a report telling me their boss was, in fact, that dumbass with the knife you killed when you arrived. This one was their janitor. Oh well, remember what I said about civilians? Anyway, your mission here is done. We're gonna send you an aircraft with the bill for your shock treatment. Don't even think about coming back without paying. Colonel, over. ; /Colonel/colonel_gg_you_win

COLONEL_civilians_1 ; Don't worry about civilians. There's no civilians here. Not in this country... At least Officially. ;  /Colonel/colonel_civilians_1

COLONEL_civilians_2 ; Y'know, there was that lad who tried to tell everyone we were the bad guys. Like we kill civilians or some lie. The funniest part is that it's not even us who put him in a jail ; /Colonel/colonel_civilians_2

COLONEL_civilians_3 ; Our new generation of military drones integrate a powerful neural network that can detect the presence of civilians with virtually 100% confidence. We also added a state-of-the-art image-blur filter. ; /Colonel/colonel_civilians_3
